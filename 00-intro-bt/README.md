# Binary Trees

A Binary Tree is represented by a list of nodes and a root node. Every node has to have a unique string id that will be referenced by other nodes' left and right pointers and by the root. This handy data structure can be used, among other things, to build Binary Search Trees, Heaps, and a bunch of other stuff.

# Binary Search Trees

A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree where each node has a Comparable key (and an associated value) and satisfies the restriction that the key in any node is larger than the keys in all nodes in that node's left subtree and smaller than the keys in all nodes in that node's right subtree.
