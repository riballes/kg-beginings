# Knowledge Graph Beginings

## Introduction

Before starting, we need to have a proper understanding of what a Graph is. A graph is a mathematical object we use to think about networks. It consists of a bunch of points, called __vertices (V)__ (also entities or nodes), and lines joining pairs of vertices, called __edges (E)__ (or relationships).

### Adjacency and Degree

‚Ä¢ We say two vertices are __adjacent (or are neighbors)__ if they are joined by an edge, and non-adjacent otherwise.

‚Ä¢ We say an edge and a vertex are incident if the vertex is one of the endpoints of the edge. The __degree of a vertex ùë£ is the number of edges incident with ùë£__.

## Trees vs Graphs

A Tree is just a restricted form of a Graph.

Trees have direction (parent / child relationships) and don't contain cycles. They fit with in the category of __Directed Acyclic Graphs (or a DAG)__. So Trees are DAGs with the restriction that a child can only have one parent.

One thing that is important to point out. Trees aren't a recursive data structure. They can not be implemented as a recursive data structure because of the above restrictions. But any DAG implementation, which are generally not recursive, can also be used. My preferred Tree implementation is a centralized map representation and is non recursive.
